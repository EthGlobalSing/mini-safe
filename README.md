Mini Safe is your friendly team multisig wallet integrated on Telegram for simplifying P2P payments.

## Description

Mini Safe is the Revolut Team Business of Web3, where you and your team members can interact with a team multisig wallet directly on Telegram, with a monthly spendable amount (starting at $1,000 for no approval required). We are using Telegram to improve user experience and create mass adoption for multisig wallets, then we want to be secured using a spendable amount.
